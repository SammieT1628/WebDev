Alright, imagine you have a light switch. This switch can be either ON or OFF, right? A boolean expression is kind of like that. It's a statement that can only be either TRUE or FALSE.

For example, let's say you have a statement: "It is raining outside." This statement can be either TRUE (if it's actually raining) or FALSE (if it's not raining). So, in programming, you use boolean expressions to make decisions. If something is TRUE, you might do one thing, and if it's FALSE, you might do something else. It's like using a switch to control what your program does based on the conditions you set.
